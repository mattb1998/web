               <div class="deafdate">December 2017</div>
               <br>
               <div class="deafinfo">Myself and 4 of my colleagues created a short documentary exploring British Sign Language with the aim of trying to find out why it is not part of the national curriculum. Our primary contact was Wayne Barrow, we wanted to tell his story of how he had an alternative ubringing and how he has used his skills to form a career and become an activist for the deaf community and for British Sign Langauge. From this we wanted to explore the matter of why BSL is not integrated into the national curriculum when the likes of French and German are, to do this we were able to interview Abiey, who uses BSL as her primary method of communication, and also Dave, who is a university lecturer, therefore we are able to see both sides of the argument.</div></div>

                <div class="zambiadate">September 2017</div>
                <br>
                <div class="zambiainfo">The Defence School of Healthcare Education at Birmingham City University were going on an internship to Zambia to work in one of th local hospitals. To help promote the trip, the work they do and the course they wanted a film made, they advertised the position and I was selected. My role was to form a rough structure to the film and edit the footage together. This was quite challenging as I was working on a blank canvas for the majority of the time and the footage was quite limiting as I requested videos but only recieved photographs. However, I used the material I had to produce this end promotional film which has been shared online and was presented at a recent symposium, the feedback I have got has been very positive. </div></div>

                <div class="studiodate">April 2017</div>
                <br>
                <div class="studioinfo">This was a group assignment at university, we were given 3 weeks to come up with a new gameshow, during this time we had to produce all the paperwork, get contributors in, form a structure to the show and then film it as if it were being commissioned. Our game show was called "Traitor", the idea was that to begin with you would be working in teams to get to win several rounds, then in the final round, the 2 members of the overall winning team would face each other to win the prize. We were all involved with the production of the show from pre-production right through to the filming stages, in order for everyone to get assessed we had to rotate roles and that involved us all taking part in the show, my assessed roles were cameraman and sound supervisor. </div></div>

                <div class="buskersdate">December 2016</div>
                <br>
                <div class="buskersinfo">This was my first university assignment and it involved a small group of us applying our location filming skills, we chose to make a short film exploring the world of busking, in particular busking in Birmingham. We were able to get 2 contributors involved with the filming and were able to interview them to get an insight to the busking world. In addition to the end film, we had to produce a production pack which included all the paperwork needed if the film was to be commmissioned on national television. My primary roles were in the pre-production and editing.</div></div>
