                <br>
                <div class="text2">I'm Matt and I'm a digital creator</div>
                <br>
                <div class="text3">I am currently in my second year of my BA(Hons) studying Media and Communication at Birmingham City University and see this as a platform for my career to really start to grow!</div>
                <br>
                <div class="text4">I was born and raised in the city of Worcester. From a young age I had an interest in technology and finding out how things worked, I also attended performing arts classes outside of school. I feel that combining technology with performance has led me to where I am today, as I want to be part of the end performance but with more of a behind the scenes role. I feel that having experienced being both in-front and behind of the camera has given me an insight and an appreciation for both worlds.</div>
                <br>
                <div class="text5">Since being at university, I have developed a real passion for the technology side of the media industry, the areas I exceed in and enjoy are post production film editing and also website design and coding. I feel these are 2 possible career paths for myself and I aim to create content around these areas to showcase my skills.</div>
                <br>
                <div class="text6">To me, the media industry is defined through storytelling, the whole sector revolves around telling stories, whether it is your own or someone elses, you are sharing it with the world. The story can be expressed in various ways, but what is important is that the story and the meaning is strong throughout, I think this is the most important thing when creating content, whatever it may be, the meaning and story has to be portrayed in a creative and powerful way.</div>
                <br>
                <div class="text7">The media industry is filled with stories, and this is my story!</div>
