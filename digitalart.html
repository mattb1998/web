            <div class="text1"> This week’s session introduced me to digital art, the aim was to understand that innovations don’t have to be traditional like a website, there is a scope for ideas. Digital art itself is any creative art form which was produced with the help of a computer or technology at some stage. We looked at some examples from various digital artists, one thing that struck me was that many of the artists have the title for a scientist, this is because they were the only people who had the knowledge and access to the technology at the time to experiment with the concept of digital art. The whole digital art industry is an umbrella statement for various projects: graphic design, gaming, film, animation, theatre etc. </div>
            
            <div class="text2">In the workshop, this week we discovered a website called Patatap, the website assigns a sound and a visual graphic to each letter on your computers keyboard. I took this concept as inspiration for my own innovation, a software that is able to assign a visual graphic to every note within a song, therefore creating a visual montage of a song. </div>
            
            <div class="text3">I came up with idea as it is something new and creative for the music industry to embrace, it is potentially a new form of music video and could lead to a new way of storytelling too. However, my primary reason for this is that the whole media industry is going through a phase called the visual shift, this is where media texts are becoming more visual based and are including images and videos to engage with its audiences. The music industry is purely based around audio so to keep the industry alive I came up with this innovation. Consequently, I don’t see a real gap in the market, it is a case of keeping up with trends and ensuring the music industry doesn’t get left behind. </div>
            
            <div class="text4">I don’t see a specific target audience either for this innovation, I expect it would appeal to musicians as it’s a new way to showcase music and therefore it’ll appeal to music fans too. I also believe there will be an audience within the social media market as this is where the visual shift is really happening and with music taking on board the visual shift, social media platforms will be the centre for sharing content.</div>
            
            <div class="text5">In terms of technology needed to produce this, it’s fairly simple as I would need a computer to create and run the software, however, the skills needed for the software would be fairly complex as I would need to improve my musical understanding to allow me to separate the music up into individual notes. In addition to this I would need to develop my animation and graphic design skills to provide variety, flow and storytelling through the visuals. To bring these components together I would need to develop my SQL and JavaScript coding to bring the visuals together.</div>
            
             <div class="text6">This innovation is key for the music industry to keep up with current trends and there is opportunity to grow too, as animation and understanding of how songs are structured and the technology works the technology could invest into creating multiple styles to the graphics so it matches the mood of the music, creating a true visual representation of the music.</div>
