        <div class="paragraph">
            
            <div class="text1"> This week we were introduced to the concept of citizen journalism, this is the idea that everyone has become journalists to a certain extent as we are all sharing information through our social media accounts and therefore constantly updating the world with the latest news. However, citizen has led to doubts in authenticity and the reliability about the news broadcast and in some cases, has led to fake news being broadcast. Consequently, there has been innovations created to help combat this issue including plugins that put the content to the test.</div>
            
            <div class="text2">I took the idea of plugins and created my own innovation this week which would act as a price comparison software that can be active when you are doing online shopping. The plugin would be able to identify what item you are looking at and it will alert you if there is a better price or deal available from another trader or website. The aim of the innovation is to help people get the best value for their money as well as being safe and preventing any scams occurring through ecommerce platforms.</div>
            
            <div class="text3">I came up with this idea as the lecture element this week made me realise how insecure and unreliable the internet can be with fake news, scamming and the spread of malware. My innovation has the aim to combat the issue of scams as well as saving people money. There are similar technologies in existing websites which compare prices of items that you search for, or there is the option of tracing the internet yourself to find the best deal, this is a gap in the market as with the introduction of this innovation it would all be done within a plugin that could be embedded into your internet browser, saving both time and money for the user.</div>
            
            <div class="text4">This innovation has the target audience of online shoppers who are always after the best value for their money. However, I do also see a market for the online traders too, as they will want to be part of the plugin to advertise their best deals, compete with other online traders and encourage trade through their websites. The introduction of this plugin will introduce a whole new way of advertisement and competition between companies.</div>
            
            <div class="text5">In terms of technology it is more the technological skills that will need to be implemented to create this innovation as I will need to be able to extract the product information from online traders to ensure the information that is presented is correct and up to date, this will be done through a PHP script and XML data feeds. I will also need to develop an understanding of how plugins work, and how to embed them into a web browser so that it is always running and is activated only when required.</div>
            
             <div class="text6">This innovation is essential to improve the security and financial status of customers who use ecommerce sites as it is difficult to know what websites are trustworthy and reliable in the digital age.</div>
