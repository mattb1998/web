            <div class="text1"> 
                This week’s session was focused around audiences, how they interpret different media texts and how their role within the media industry has changed. Stuart Hall suggested a theory known as ‘Encoding and Decoding’, this is where a media text has a meaning but audience members can decode this meaning in different ways depending on how they understand the media text. We also understood that the role of audiences has changed, originally audiences received media, however now they are able to interact with the content and immerse themselves on multiple platforms. Consequently, the term ‘audiences’ could be considered obsolete, a more appropriate term was suggested by Lawrence Lessig, ‘Produsers’, as audiences can now read and write media. </div>
            <div class="text2">From this week, I wanted to create an innovation that would make all members of the audience feel included, therefore I came up with the idea of an application that scans text and translates those words into speech. Similar technologies do exist within the market however, they only translate a written or physical document into onscreen versions of the text, my idea is to extend this so that any written or processed text can be turned into audio. I believe this is a gap in the market and if the technology was to be implemented it would benefit both the industry and its audiences.</div>
            <div class="text3">I came up with this idea to assist audience members and make them feel valued, not everyone is able to read and those that can don’t necessarily enjoy it, as a result an audio version of the of the same text may be a preferred way of receiving the text. This would be similar to audiobooks; however, this innovation would enable any written text to be transferred into audio.</div>
            <div class="text4">My initial target audience was to help those who simply don’t enjoy reading or prefer an audio version of a book or a piece of text. However, upon reflection and looking into the market further, I realised there is a much broader market for this technology as it could be very useful for those with visual impairments or disabilities such as dyslexia. Having the text read to them allows them to understand a text without needing to read it therefore everyone is included, everyone is able to access the same information just in different formats.</div>
            
            <div class="text5">In order for this to be implemented a technology known as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or more commonly called hand writing recognition would be required. This enables a computer to scan sentences and identify individual letters forming an onscreen version of text. To accomplish the audio format of the text, a database would be required to relate to as each word will be assigned to an audio version of itself, by combining words together to form sentences, a verbal version of the document will be produced. I would need to develop my coding skills and improve my understanding of how OCR actually works to implement this technology as it is at the centre of how the application will function. </div>
            
            <div class="text6">I definitely see potential for this technology as it would help many people in various ways. I also see space for development as texts could be scanned and could also be translated into various languages, making communicating easier as well as educating its audiences. </div>
